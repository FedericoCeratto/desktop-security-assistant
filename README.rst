Desktop security assistant
==========================

An easy to use tool for desktop users to improve the security of their system.

It scans your Linux desktop or laptop and provide a set of suggestions.


How is it different from security scanners like Tiger?
------------------------------------------------------

* Focused on desktop users rather than servers administrators
* Provides suggestions on every aspect of security: software and hardware configuration and usage
* Hints on risk level and work required to mitigate it

Development status
------------------

In development. Testing and contributions are welcome!
